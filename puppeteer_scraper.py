mediamarkt-scraper — pyppeteer edition (secondary engine)
=====================================================

The same scrape as playwright_scraper.py, driven through pyppeteer. It must
agree with its twins on exit codes, run status, and whether a run crashes or
spends money — the decisions that determine all three live in page_flow.py
and output_writer.finish_run(), so this file is browser plumbing and nothing
else.

    --mode listing   (default)  category grids and search results
    --mode product              one /product/ page, with brand, EAN,
                                description and the full image list

Two things to know before choosing this engine:

  * **pyppeteer is effectively unmaintained** and its own README points at
    Playwright. It is here for parity, and for anyone who already has it.
  * **No --concurrency.** The Playwright engine is the one that fetches pages
    in parallel; the flag is accepted here and reported as ignored rather
    than silently doing nothing.

Usage
-----
    python puppeteer_scraper.py \\
        --url "https://www.mediamarkt.de/de/category/grills-116.html" --pages 3

Requires: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-puppeteer.txt
          (pyppeteer downloads its own Chromium on first run)
