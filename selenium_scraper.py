mediamarkt-scraper — Selenium edition (secondary engine)
====================================================

The same scrape as playwright_scraper.py, driven through Selenium. It must
agree with its twins on exit codes, run status, and whether a run crashes or
spends money — the decisions that determine all three live in page_flow.py
and output_writer.finish_run(), so this file is browser plumbing and nothing
else.

    --mode listing   (default)  category grids and search results
    --mode product              one /product/ page, with brand, EAN,
                                description and the full image list

Two limits of this engine, stated here rather than left to be discovered.
Neither is a bug in this code and neither can be fixed from here:

  * **Selenium cannot use an authenticated remote CDP endpoint.** Playwright's
    `connect_over_cdp` and pyppeteer's `browserWSEndpoint` take a full
    `ws://user:pass@host:port` and authenticate on the WebSocket upgrade.
    chromedriver's `debuggerAddress` takes a bare `host:port` and has nowhere
    to put a password. So --cdp-endpoint here works only for an endpoint that
    needs no credentials; a credentialed one is refused with exit 2 rather
    than connected to and silently failing.
  * **Selenium cannot authenticate a proxy at all.** `--proxy-server=` accepts
    no credentials, and there is no equivalent of pyppeteer's
    `page.authenticate`. Credentials are stripped and a warning says so, so
    nobody believes a `user:pass` URL is doing something.

There is no --concurrency here either: parallel page fetching lives in the
Playwright engine.

Usage
-----
    python selenium_scraper.py \\
        --url "https://www.mediamarkt.de/de/category/grills-116.html" --pages 3

Requires: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-selenium.txt
          Selenium 4 fetches a matching chromedriver itself; a local Chrome
          or Chromium must be installed.
